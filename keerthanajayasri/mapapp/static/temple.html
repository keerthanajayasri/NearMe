The Sripuram Golden Temple is a sight to behold, and it is situated
in Tirumalaikodi at Southern Vellore, Tamil Nadu. The golden temple 
sits inside a spiritual park or ‘Spiritual Oasis’, and a star path
 leads the visitors towards it.The main feature of the temple has 
 to be that it is covered in real gold foil and it is regarded as 
 the biggest and the only temple to do that.
